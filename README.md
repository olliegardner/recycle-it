# Recycle It
A recycling that app was built for the Sustainability track at the JunctionX Exeter Hackathon 2020 (https://junctionxexeter.com/). The hackathon was spread over 3 days and lasted for 52 hours.  

## The Challenge
> Forrests cover nearly 30 percent of the world's land area. But they're dissapearing at an alarming rate. Over the past 30 years the Earth has lost over 1.3 million square kilometres of forrest. Should the global population reach 9.6 billion by 2050, the equivalent of over 3 planets will be required to provide the natural resources needed to sustain our lifestyles. The food sector accounts for about 30 percent of the world's total energy consumption and nearly 22 percent of total greenhouse gas emissions. Does your team have what it takes to beat the competition and create a revolutionary product?

## Our Solution
We created a Flutter app who's aim is to solve the world's massive waste problem by reducing the amount of recyclable material sent to landfill everyday. The app allows users to take pictures of their rubbish and in return they will find out if their rubbish can be recycled and which coloured bin they should put it in.
